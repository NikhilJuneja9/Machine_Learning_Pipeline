# Summary.

Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Here are the key highlights:

Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.
### Feature Engineering:
* Utilized simple imputation techniques to handle missing data.
* Performed column transformations to enhance feature representation.
### Model Building and Evaluation:
* Trained a Decision Tree machine learning model.
* Achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test dataset.
### Feature Selection:
* Explored feature importance and selected relevant features.
### Data and Tools:
* Used the famous Titanic dataset.
* Employed libraries such as pandas, numpy, and MinMaxScaler.
* Serialized the trained model using pickling for easy deployment.


This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. It demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets and deliver meaningful insights
